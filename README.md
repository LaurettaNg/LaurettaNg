# About Me

With a **PhD in Animal Breeding and Genetics**, I have extensive experience working with large datasets, applying advanced statistical methods, and solving complex problems in the context of genetics and breeding. 
### My areas of expertise include : 
Data Science & Machine Learning: Predictive modeling, regression analysis, clustering, time series analysis, neural networks, and deep learning.

Quantitative Genetics: Genetic Prediction, Breeding Value estimation, Genetic variation, and Gene-Environment interactions.

Statistical Modeling: Bayesian statistics, Mixed models, Hypothesis testing, and Experimental design.

Bioinformatics: Data analysis pipelines, genomic data processing, variant calling, and SNP analysis.

Programming Languages & Tools: Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow), R (ggplot2, dplyr, caret), SQL, MATLAB, Git, and Jupyter Notebooks.

# My Current Role

Today, I leverage these skills as a **Data Scientist** at an **Telus Agriculture and Consumer Goods**, where I provide data-driven insights that help consultants make strategic recommendations, enabling our clients to optimize their operations and achieve their goals. I apply a blend of **Statistical modeling**, **Predictive analytics**, and **Machine learning** to address a variety of challenges in Animal Agriculture. 

### Programming Languages & Tools

I have a strong foundation in a variety of programming languages and data tools, enabling me to work across different platforms. My expertise spans:

Programming Languages: Python (with libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow), R (ggplot2, dplyr, caret), SQL for data manipulation.

Data Management & Cloud Platforms: Experience with Snowflake for cloud data warehousing and efficient data management, ensuring scalable and high-performance data pipelines.

Data Visualization: Proficient in Tableau for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations that help translate complex data insights into actionable business strategies.

Version Control: Familiar with Git for version control, enabling collaboration and ensuring reproducibility of data analysis workflows.

Jupyter Notebooks:For creating and sharing live documents that combine code, visualizations, and narrative text, providing a powerful tool for interactive data analysis.

With this toolkit, I am able to seamlessly integrate data science techniques, cloud-based solutions, and visualization tools to extract actionable insights, optimize operations, and support data-driven decision-making.

# Passion and Expertise
